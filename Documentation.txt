Linpack:
The LINPACK benchmark is based around having the machine solve a dense system of linear equations from a linear algebra library that is optomozed for that specific machine. LINPACK is used to determine the TOP500 list, and is a reliable benchmark. However, it is important to note that this benchmark does not measure the total performance of a system, it simply measures the performance of the system at linear algrbra. For other measures, we will use additional benchmarks.

MySQL:
MySQL (SQL - Structured Query Language) is a relational database management system and typically stresses memory, IPC, filesystem, and networking subsystems. We will use SysBench with MySQL to test a single MySQL Server instance (by running different tests). The measurements provided by the SysBench tests will be statistics of transaction latency and throughput in transactions per seconds and will help determine if the MySQL server is running as expected. 

Redis: 
We are using the Redis and utilizing the included redis-benchmark utility to simulate running command by x number of clients at the same time sending M total                    of queries. For the benchmark we will measure Redis requests on multiple deployment scenarios (Docker and Native client) and we will measure Average latency of
operations on diffrent Redis deployments.

Random Access Memory:
Random Access Memories is the fourth and final studio album by French electronic duo Daft Punk, released on 17 May 2013 through Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles.
