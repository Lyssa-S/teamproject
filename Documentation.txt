Linpack:
The LINPACK benchmark is based around having the machine solve a dense system of linear equations from a linear algebra library that is optomozed for that specific machine. LINPACK is used to determine the TOP500 list, and is a reliable benchmark. However, it is important to note that this benchmark does not measure the total performance of a system, it simply measures the performance of the system at linear algrbra. For other measures, we will use additional benchmarks.
