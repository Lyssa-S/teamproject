Linpack:
The LINPACK benchmark is based around having the machine solve a dense system of linear equations from a linear algebra library that is optomozed for that specific machine. LINPACK is used to determine the TOP500 list, and is a reliable benchmark. However, it is important to note that this benchmark does not measure the total performance of a system, it simply measures the performance of the system at linear algrbra. For other measures, we will use additional benchmarks.

MySQL:
MySQL is a relational database management system, SQL stands for Structured Query Language

Redis: 
We are using the Redis and utilizing the included redis-benchmark utility to simulate running command by x number of clients at the same time sending M total
of queries. For the benchmark we will measure Redis requests on multiple deployment scenarios (Docker and Native client) and we will measure Average latency of
operations on diffrent Redis deployments.
